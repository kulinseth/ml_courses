#Oxford Machine Learning course

Tracks Homeworks, assignments of [Oxford ML course](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/). The Lab
work is done in Torch. Some of the assignments have implementation component which is again implemented in Torch

## Lab

The [Lab assignments](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2015/) are:

1. Practical1 - Playing with Torch and getting familiar with Lua
2. Practical2 - Linear and non-linear models in Torch using toy data
3. Practical3 - Logistic with MNIST data set. Trying different opt techniques
4. Practical4 - Simple NN on Iris dataset
5. Practical5 - nngraph, own LSTM implementation, computation graph
6. Practical6 - using LSTM in an example sequence and improving the performance

## Exercises

1. ProblemSet1 - Linear algebra review, linear regression, probability ...
  1. Scale mixtures of Gaussians and applying that trick to natural images
  2. Linear regression and regularization
  3. Eigendecompositions, SVD and applying it on some test images

2. ProblemSet2 - Collaborative filtering
  1. Applying it to Movie recommendation in Torch
  2. Applying it to Missing votes in Torch

3. ProblemSet3 - Logistic, Neural nets
  1. Log-likelihood and logistic regression
  2. Similarly for multinomial logistic regression
  3. NN and XOR gate
  4. ReLU and dropout

4. ProblemSet4 - Review, compare and contrast these papers 
  1. [Very deep CNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)
  2. [Going deeper with convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)
